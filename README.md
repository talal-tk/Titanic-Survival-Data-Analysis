# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Data Analysis
📘 Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that affected passenger survival during the tragic
shipwreck. Using data science techniques, the goal is to explore, visualize, and build predictive models to estimate the likelihood of survival.

🎯 Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify survival patterns

Build and evaluate machine learning models for survival prediction

Interpret and visualize the results

🧠 Methods and Tools

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification modeling

⚙️ Models Used

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier (achieved the highest accuracy)

📊 Results

The Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved the best performance in predicting survival, showing strong results in terms of accuracy and generalization.

🔍 Insights

Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate.

Passengers in higher classes (1st class) were more likely to survive.

Age and family size also played key roles in survival chances.

🚀 Future Improvements

Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy

Try deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks)

Deploy the model using a web interface (e.g., Streamlit)
